*Backround*

Completed in 1945, the ENIAC was the first programmable, electronic, general-purpose digital computer. These features might be found in combinations on other computers, but the ENIAC had them all in one device.

**Processor type:**

The ENIAC processed operations in sequence. Even though the ENIAC had parallel processing, it wasn't frequently employed because series processing at the time had a strong processing power and didn't require much parallel processing.

**Specs:**

The machine was constructed of 40 panels that were positioned along three of the room's walls in a U configuration. The machine also contained 70,000 resistors, 17,000 vacuum tubes, 10,000 capacitors, 1,500 relays and 6,000 switches, each of which was 8 feet high, 2 feet wide and 2 feet deep.

**Memory**

The quick access-time memory capacity of the ENIAC was increased by 100 words using a parallel static magnetic memory device. The ENIAC now only has 20 words of electronic accumulator-based internal memory.

# **Comparison Mac vs. ENIAC**

The differenec between a 2020 MacBook Pro to an ENIAC computer is that many modern laptop computers are only a few pounds and are capable of performing several billion operations per second, whereas ENIAC could only process 5,000 addition problems per second. Modern laptops, despite their strength, are slow in comparison to supercomputers of the same era.
