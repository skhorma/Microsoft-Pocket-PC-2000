*Backround*

Completed in 1945, the ENIAC was the first programmable, electronic, general-purpose digital computer. These features might be found in combinations on other computers, but the ENIAC had them all in one device.

**Processor type:**

The ENIAC processed operations in sequence. Even though the ENIAC had parallel processing, it wasn't frequently employed because series processing at the time had a strong processing power and didn't require much parallel processing.

**Specs:**

The machine was constructed of 40 panels that were positioned along three of the room's walls in a U configuration. The machine also contained 70,000 resistors, 17,000 vacuum tubes, 10,000 capacitors, 1,500 relays and 6,000 switches, each of which was 8 feet high, 2 feet wide and 2 feet deep.

**Memory**

The quick access-time memory capacity of the ENIAC was increased by 100 words using a parallel static magnetic memory device. The ENIAC now only has 20 words of electronic accumulator-based internal memory.
